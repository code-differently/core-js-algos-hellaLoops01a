### Lab: Pair Programming with "Ping Pong" Method

**Objective:** To practice using for loops in JavaScript to create various geometric shapes in the console while employing pair programming techniques, specifically the "Ping Pong" method.

---

### Introduction to Pair Programming:

Pair programming is a collaborative coding practice where two programmers work together at one workstation. It is an effective way to share knowledge, improve code quality, and enhance team communication.

#### Roles:

1. **Driver:** The person who writes the code.
2. **Navigator:** The person who reviews each line of code as it is typed, considers the overall direction, and provides insights on how to proceed.

#### "Ping Pong" Method:

In the "Ping Pong" approach, partners regularly switch roles. One partner writes a test, the other partner makes the test pass by writing code, and then they switch roles for the next test. For this lab, youâ€™ll adapt this method for creating shapes:

1. **Partner A** writes the for loop structure without filling in the logic.
2. **Partner B** completes the logic to make the shape work.
3. Switch roles for the next shape.

### Instructions:

Work in pairs to create the following shapes in your JavaScript console using for loops. After completing a shape, switch roles for the next one.

#### 1. Line

- **Description:** Create a horizontal line made of asterisks.
- **Expected Output:** (for a line of length 5)

  ```

#### 2. Square

- **Description:** Create a square made of asterisks.
- **Expected Output:** (for a 4x4 square)

  ```

#### 3. Rectangle
- **Description:** Create a rectangle made of asterisks.
- **Expected Output:** (for a 5x3 rectangle)
